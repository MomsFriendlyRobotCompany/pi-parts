# Summary

An OpenSCAD model of the Raspberry Pi Zero that I've made to test some print models I'm working on.

Currently only v1.2 board, v1.3 will follow later.  I'll possibly also add modules to show connectors later...

Feel free to include this in projects you're playing with (possibly as a check model for cases...).  I'd appreciate a message if you find it useful.

If you're using OpenSCAD then you need to use
"PiZeroBody();"
The dimensions I've used are from direct measurement, use the "include" statement if you want to use them in your own project, otherwise its "use".
