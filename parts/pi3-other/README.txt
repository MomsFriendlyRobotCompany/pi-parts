# Summary

A quick 3D representation of the Raspberry Pi 1B+, Pi 2 and Pi 3 model motherboards using the official specifications. It is not meant to be 3D printed.

Mechanical drawing obtained from here:
http://www.raspiworld.com/images/other/drawings/Raspberry-Pi-1-2-3-Model-B.jpg

The mounting holes, Micro USB power port, HDMI port, 1/8" audio jack, Ethernet Jack, and USB port placement and exterior size is exact to specifications. However, the internal pins and design on these plugs is estimated. I felt these little details were not important when using this model as a stand in for other Raspberry Pi projects.

The size and placement of the Camera port, Display port, SD Card slot, GPIO ports, Broadcom SOC, Ethernet Controller, and DDR Ram chip are all estimated.

Feel free to remix to your heart's content, especially if you have better measurements of the items I estimated or if you have found other mistakes in the model. I've used this model several times without issue, however, I tend to over compensate slightly with sizing of exterior ports.

Please double check all measurements before using this model in your own creation.
